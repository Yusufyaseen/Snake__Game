 ********* ( The game has a primary function the call it self every certain bunch of seconds or many times in second , at the expense of the setting of the game and render the page too , it is like ( setInterval ) function ) *********

1-We add the head of the snake manually.
2-we add the node that contain food from (food.js). 
3-then when the head grid == food grid , we will erase every child is our gameBoard div and increase a certain value as (neSegments) with one.
4-then we have a function which can in role create a neSegments nodes (Body of the snake).
5-there is a function that randomly put the food node i random grid.
6-when the head crash to it is body or outside the grid the game will be finished.
7-at the end there is a confirm appears has your fucking score and ask you to start another game or to stop playing.
8-Thanks yusuf for you efforts.
